## Who can play?
Anyone can play it is a fairly simple game intended for 1-4 players

## How to play
Players are asked to log in. Each player is given $1,000 when they first sign up to bet with. At the start of each round the player will be asked how much they would like to bet. They will then be given two cards. At this same time the dealer is dealt one card face up and one face down. If the dealer has a 10, jack, queen, king, or ace the player will be asked if they want to purchase insurance. Insurance is incase the dealer has 21. If the player has 2 cards of the same value they are given the choice to split. Splitting means that the player will now have two hands of the same bet each. The player is then dealt one more card per hand and their turn is ended. If they choose not to split or never had the option then they are given the option to double down. Their bet is doubled, they are dealt one card, and their turn is ended. If a player chooses to skip all of these options then the game proceeds normally. The player is asked if they would like to "hit" (get another card). They are prompted with this choice until they either exceed 21 or choose not to continue.

## How do you win?
Despite their being multiple players the game is played between each player and the dealer. Once the player ends their turn the dealer will either hit or hold depending on their cards. Of the two whoever is closer to 21, without exceeding it, is the winner. If the player exceeds 21 they lose. If both the player and the dealer exceed 21 the player loses. However, if both the player and the dealer have 21 a push happens. This means that no one wins. The house does not win any money and the player does not lose any money.
